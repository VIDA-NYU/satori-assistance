  Analyze the input image and determine the status of each checkpoint for the current step. Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

  {
    "checkpoints": [
      {
        "description": "[Checkpoint description]",
        "analysis": "[Detailed analysis based on visual evidence]",
        "status": "[COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/NOT_STARTED]"
      }
      /* Repeat for each checkpoint */
    ],
    "overallAnalysis": "[Comprehensive analysis of the entire image in relation to the current step]",
    "overallStatus": "[PROCESSING/COMPLETED/NOT_STARTED/UNRELATED]"
  }

  For each checkpoint:
  1. Provide a detailed analysis of the visual evidence related to the checkpoint.
  2. Based on your analysis, determine the status using one of the following codes:
     - COMPLETED: Visual evidence clearly shows this checkpoint has been accomplished.
     - IN_PROGRESS: There is evidence that this checkpoint has been started but not completed.
     - NOT_STARTED: No visual evidence of progress on this checkpoint.

  For the overall analysis:
  1. Provide a comprehensive analysis of the entire image in relation to the current step.
  2. If the image appears unrelated, explain why it doesn't match the current step and, if possible, suggest which step it might be related to or what action the user appears to be performing instead.
  3. Based on your analysis, determine the overall status using one of the following codes:
     - PROCESSING: At least one checkpoint is in progress or completed, but not all are completed.
     - COMPLETED: All checkpoints are completed.
     - NOT_STARTED: No checkpoints have been started.
     - UNRELATED: The current image reflects a different step or an unrelated action.

  Ensure that your analysis for each checkpoint and the overall step is thorough and based on specific visual evidence from the image.
